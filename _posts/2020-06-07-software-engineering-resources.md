Decided to list down some of the resources that I found useful for not just preparing for a bootcamp but also general learning materials to get myself in the right frame of mind for software engineering.

### [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/)
Highly recommended. CS50x is online course from Harvard breaks down key concepts in computer science and takes you from basic programming to building a full fledged app (mobile/web/game) in 8 weeks/sections. Learning curve is steep if you do not have any background. But if you do have some basic programming background, it is a great refresher on fundamentals of programming, sorting algorithms and data structures. Special mention to CS50 IDE, their cloud-based IDE with built in automated checks for the accuracy of your coding assignments.

### [Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software](https://www.amazon.sg/Code-Language-Computer-Hardware-Software/dp/0735611319)
Slightly old but still highly relevant. Great read for both casuals, aspiring developers and advanced level programmers. Certain parts might get a bit dry (like a textbook) when the author starts explaining key concepts, but if you stick through it he literally describes how a computer works from simple switches and relays to "modern" day computers. Things like processor speed, memory, storage and code becomes immediately clear and intuitive.

### [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/)
1,800 hours worth of coding practices with guides. Excellent for practicing the concepts and syntax for specific languages and helps condition your mind to think algorithmically. Good as accesory work after picking up the main concepts from class or other resources. Pick and choose the topics that you would need more help in.

### [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)
Recommended by one of my TAs. I have used git/github in my previous work but never really understood how it all works. Great resource for understanding the inner workings of Git.

### [How to ask Questions the Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)
Saw this floating around when I started at Grab. Ever since then, I realised that asking questions the right way is as important as asking the right questions. Works with non-technical questions too. Seems trivial, but definitely worth a skim to pick up the key ideas.
